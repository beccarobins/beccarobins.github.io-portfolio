I"Z<p>I’ve needed my ass kicked for a while now. I set out to launch this first post 10 months ago. And no, I haven’t been too busy…I’ve been doing all the things I shouldn’t. Letting perfect be the enemy of good, paralysis by analysis, and all those very cheesy, but very apt sayings that boil down to one thing: <strong>getting in my own way</strong>.</p>

<p>For someone in tech, I’m a bit of a luddite. I mean, I’m <em>starting</em> a blog in <del>2021</del> 2022…I grew up when LiveJournal was <em>just</em> becoming big and yet here I am now, writing my <em>first</em> blog. But I’ve decided to finally bite the bullet and begin writing things down because I realized I actually <em>do</em> have a point-of-view that may (or may not) be worth sharing. Historically, I’ve had many opinions (some <em>terrible</em>) but now that I’m climbing up that figurative hill of life (or running, as Summer 2022 will have us remember), I feel I <em>finally</em> have <strong>direction</strong>.</p>

<p>So what should you expect from this weekly (oh god, that’s not going to happen), monthly, maybe bi-annual blog series. It’s going to be all about content—sort of. It’s going to be about <em>creating</em> content, but not the content itself. What does this mean? I <strong>won’t</strong> talk about the ideal number of words for your blog post or SEO (that’s not my bag, baby), but I <strong>will</strong> talk about how you can leverage technical tools to your advantage, how you can “appropriate” (<em>technology appropriation, not cultural appropriation</em>) from other fields to make your content better, and I will talk (a hell of a lot, probably) about content operations and process improvements because I’m damn good at them.</p>

<p>In case that didn’t entice you, you’ll also get some great (and totally unrelated) cat content, like the two rascals below.</p>
