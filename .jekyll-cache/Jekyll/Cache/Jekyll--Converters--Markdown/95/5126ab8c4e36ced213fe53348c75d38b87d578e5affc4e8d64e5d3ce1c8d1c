I"<p>Engineers and data scientists are always talking about their â€œstackâ€. OK okay, engineers and data scientists <em>on social media</em> are the ones â€œalways talkingâ€ about their stack, but theyâ€™re not the only ones in tech with a stack. Content has its own stack, and while it may not be as vast or deep as that of an engineer, itâ€™s certainly worth mentioning.</p>

<p>Here, Iâ€™ll provide an overview of some key parts of the stack. Iâ€™ll go into more depth on the elements that are more pervasive (such as markup languages), but less so on the parts that are often developed internally (like authoring tools) or have <em>way</em> too many proprietary options to keep these posts relatively succinct (content management systems). Alright, so here is what you will see in the series:</p>
