I"Å<p>If you work in content, you probably spend an enormous amount of time either giving or receiving feedback. The best feedback <em>evolves</em> your content, while bad feedback leaves you saying ‚ÄúSo, what is it you actually want me to do?‚Äù Writing good feedback isn‚Äôt the easiest either, but fortunately, it‚Äôs a skill anyone can build.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had days where 90% of my time was spent writing feedback. What I‚Äôve learned is that the best way to <em>get your feedback heard</em> is through clarity. Crystal clarity.</p>

<h2 id="-burn-the-sandwich">üî• Burn the sandwich</h2>

<p>You‚Äôve probably heard of the feedback sandwich‚Äîwhere you provide a piece of critical feedback by ‚Äúsandwiching‚Äù it between two compliments. This is meant to soften the blow of the criticism. It‚Äôs transparent, unhelpful, and in some cases, insulting. What it really does is wash away your feedback. Save your sandwiches for lunch! Or breakfast. Or second breakfast.</p>

<p>Using the feedback sandwich is <em>especially</em> bad for newbies. Individuals who are early in their career (obviously) have less practice giving feedback, which often means their feedback is less clear. When surrounded by compliments, the recipient usually takes this feedback as a ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù or interprets it as unimportant. This, of course, becomes needlessly frustrating for the reviewer. During their next review, they find that little to none of their feedback has been incorporated and they have to provide it all over again. How rude.</p>

<h2 id="the-becca-method">The Becca method</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve slowly been building up the following method of providing feedback over the last five years. It works best when you‚Äôre a subject matter expert (SME) in the area you‚Äôre reviewing (steps 3 &amp; 4 can be difficult without expertise), but you can always plug in analogous examples for those steps</p>

<h3 id="step-1---provide-absolute-clarity">Step 1 - Provide absolute clarity</h3>

<p>Give <em>crystal clear</em> feedback. Be specific. Be candid. You don‚Äôt need to be insulting to do either of those things, I promise. The goal is to ensure your author has <strong>zero</strong> confusion about the issue. Don‚Äôt leave it to interpretation.</p>

<!-- >> EXAMPLE-->

<h3 id="step-2---justify-your-critique">Step 2 - Justify your critique</h3>

<p>Why are you giving this feedback? Is it an issue of content guidelines? Is clarity an issue? Understanding where your critique comes from will give your author a better idea of how to fix it. Better yet, it could help prevent future issues.</p>

<!-- >> EXAMPLE-->

<h3 id="step-3---lead-by-example">Step 3 - Lead by example</h3>

<p>What could be an alternative way to do this? If you have a clear example that further demonstrates your point, use it. However, be careful with this one. If you‚Äôre working with less experienced writers, you might end up providing examples again and again‚Äîessentially writing for them. Sometimes a better approach is to show an analogous example.</p>

<!-- >> EXAMPLE-->

<h3 id="step-4---show-the-effect">Step 4 - Show the effect</h3>

<p>Why would that alternative be better? Build on your example by examining <em>why</em> it improves the work.</p>

<h3 id="emojis">Emojis</h3>

<p>If you have <em>a lot</em> of feedback to provide, justifying it and providing examples can be pretty cumbersome, and frankly overkill. Using emojis (along with a key) can provide the clarity you need. Just make sure your chosen emojis are clear and you aren‚Äôt using too many. For example, the following key is short and sweet:</p>

<ul>
  <li>‚≠ê (star) - Excellent point! Well done!</li>
  <li>üòï (confused) - This is unclear. I don‚Äôt understand what you mean here.</li>
  <li>üêõ (bug) - Something is broken. Please fix.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert-warning">

    <strong>Warning!</strong> <i>Emojis are not accessible to all</i>. Assistive technology doesn't necessarily respond well to emojis and may read out confusing phrases or even skip over lines with emojis entirely. If your feedback system is set up using emojis, make sure to test it out with screen readers or adopt an alternative method (a replace-all method could potentially work here) if your feedback recipient uses assistive tech.

<h3 id="canned-feedback">Canned feedback</h3>

<p>If you review a lot of the same type of content, you probably provide a lot of the <em>same</em> feedback. It can be frustrating to write and rewrite the same thing over and over. Having a standing bank of feedback can help out. Collect feedback you‚Äôve already given in a doc or a spreadsheet. Review and edit your feedback to be more ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù, that is, if you‚Äôve mentioned something <em>really</em> specific, like an author‚Äôs name, you can remove it, so that‚Äôs easier to copy and paste next time. You can reuse unrelated examples, but make sure to include a ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù to make sure your current author understands your intent.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done something similar in two previous roles and it significantly reduced the time I spent writing feedback. I made sure to provide a reason for my comment, a justification along with a reference (to ensure my authors that my comment was not an opinion), and a before and after to demonstrate the potential improvement.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Giving (and receiving) feedback is a crucial skill in any field, but as content people, reviews are a staple of our workflow. The ability to craft feedback that is understandable and actionable is crucial to moving content closer to launch. A systematic approach that provides clarity and sets expectations can help achieve this goal.</p>
