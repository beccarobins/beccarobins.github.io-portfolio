After I'd been working at DataCamp for a while, I noticed that I was making the same edits and providing the same feedback to instructors again and again. I spoke with my fellow Content Developers and it turns out I was not the only one. This was a source of frustration for everyone but beyond sending instructors links to the documentation alongside their feedback, not much was done.

I decided to take note from my previous work as an editor (see: Supporting scientists across the globe) and build up a bank of "quick tips" for the team. I started by gathering ideas for tips through discussions at team meetings and by looking through previous feedback given to instructors. As I built up the tip bank, I added new tips as I was giving them to instructors.

## Results & take-homes
While creating these quick tips, I realized that these should be quick not only for the instructors receiving them, but also for the Content Developer searching them. This lead to the addition of categories that could be easily filtered.
