International Society of Posture & Gait Research World Congress 2022
Location: Hotel Bonaventure, Montreal, Canada
Date: July 3, 2022
Workshop: The job seeker’s toolkit: what you need to effectively manage your career search both in and outside of academia.
Description: The learning and tools provided in this workshop will appeal to many that are job-seeking both inside and outside of academia. Of the nearly 400 student members, the majority of those are Ph.D. candidates — eligible for internships or interviewing for postgraduate paths. The presenters are representative of the broad research areas that ISPGR student members associate with — aging, balance control, and emerging tech. While the presenters are all currently employed in the US, many are from elsewhere or left the US along their academic journeys; we hope that these diverse backgrounds and experiences resonate with many and encourage workshop attendance. During this workshop, you will learn to: Identify which of your skills are valuable in and out of the lab Summarize your personal achievements clearly and effectively in multiple modalities Apply the STAR model to answer interview questions succinctly and successfully Create an inviting and professional media presence Evaluate your current personal branding strategy.

Workshop: Pursuing an industry position after graduate school
International Society of Posture & Gait Research World Congress 2022
Location: Hotel Bonaventure, Montreal, Canada
Date: July 3, 2022
Workshop: The job seeker’s toolkit: what you need to effectively manage your career search both in and outside of academia.
Description: Graduates with advanced degrees in human movement disciplines are often interested in non-academic career pathways. However, graduates are typically provided with very little perspective or direction in how to consider a non-academic career. This workshop will provide 1) an overview of common non-academic career pathways, 2) presentations from ISPGR members with significant non-academic employment, 3) Q&A session with the panel, and 4) open time for relationship building. The presentation is geared toward graduate students and academic faculty interested in a non-academic career. However, established academic researchers may also find the workshop interesting to help in their mentoring of graduate students in career directions.

International Society of Posture & Gait Research World Congress 2022
Location: Hotel Bonaventure, Montreal, Canada
Date: July 3, 2022
Workshop: The job seeker’s toolkit: what you need to effectively manage your career search both in and outside of academia.
Description: Buzzwords like “data science”, “machine learning”, “artificial intelligence”, “digital transformation”, and “big data” are often thrown around the business world with reckless abandon. But what do these phrases actually mean? How is data used at modern companies? And more importantly, how can you get involved? Join Women in Data NYC at our first symposium of 2019, where we’ll hear firsthand from data scientists about their experiences working in the data industry. At this event, you’ll learn how data science can be applied to real-world problems, how you can expand your skill set to be a leader in the field of data, and how to stand out in the recruiting process.
