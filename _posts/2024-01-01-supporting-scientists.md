Once upon a time, I was an academic and a scientific editor. My work as an editor required a non-disclosure agreement, therefore the visuals and copy throughout this case study are recreations based on that work.

## Problem statement
From March 2016 to August 2017 I worked part-time as a freelance editor for Cactus Communications in the Center of Excellence for Neuroscience and Neurology. My main responsibility was to help prepare research articles for submission for our international clientele. 

During this time, I took on more than 60 freelance jobs.

Deliverables included: 
- An edited version of the original articles with track changes
- A letter from the editor
- A cover letter to the submission journal
- An edited version of a revisions document


## Process
- Looking up guidelines for the specific journal

Most jobs included an "editor's report

## Results & take-homes
Once of the most difficult aspects of this work was balancing a formal tone of voice while ensuring clarity for the user (exclusively non-native English speakers). 

During the time I worked at Cactus, I built up a "bank" of quick tips.
